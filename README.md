This project is my experimental project mainly used to study physical animation and self-balancing ragdoll

The main gameplay of this game is to place NPCs and watch the war between NPCs


Due to the particularity of the code, part of the core code has not been uploaded to Github.

The concept of self-balancing ragdolls comes from Rockstarâ€™s ragdoll system, 
which makes NPC ragdolls very effective in the two games Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne.
